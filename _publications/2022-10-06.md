Beyond transferring genetic information, RNAs are molecules with diverse functions that include catalyzing biochemical reactions and regulating gene expression. Most of these activities depend on RNAs’ specific structures. Therefore, accurately determining RNA structure is integral to advancing our understanding of RNA functions. Here, we summarize the state-of-the-art experimental and computational technologies developed to evaluate RNA secondary and tertiary structures. We also highlight how the rapid increase of experimental data facilitates the integrative modeling approaches for better resolving RNA structures. Finally, we provide our thoughts on the latest advances and challenges in RNA structure determination methods, as well as on future directions for both experimental approaches and artificial intelligence-based computational tools to model RNA structure. Ultimately, we hope the technological advances will deepen our understanding of RNA biology and facilitate RNA structure-based biomedical research such as designing specific RNA structures for therapeutics and deploying RNA-targeting small-molecule drugs.
