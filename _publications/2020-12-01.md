Small regulatory RNAs, such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs, regulate splicing, transcription, and genome integrity in many eukaryotes. In Caenorhabditis elegans, siRNAs bind nuclear Argonautes (AGOs), which interact with homologous premessenger RNAs to recruit downstream silencing effectors, such as NRDE-2, to direct cotranscriptional gene silencing [or nuclear RNA interference (RNAi)]. To further our understanding of the mechanism of nuclear RNAi, we conducted immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry on C. elegansNRDE-2. The major NRDE-2 interacting protein identified was the RNA helicase MTR-4. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses confirmed a physical association between NRDE-2 and MTR-4. MTR-4 colocalizes with NRDE-2 within the nuclei of most/all C. elegans somatic and germline cells. MTR-4 is required for nuclear RNAi, and interestingly, MTR-4 is recruited to premessenger RNAs undergoing nuclear RNAi via a process requiring nuclear siRNAs, the nuclear AGO HRDE-1, and NRDE-2, indicating that MTR-4 is a component of the C. elegans nuclear RNAi machinery. Finally, we confirm previous reports showing that human (Hs)NRDE2 and HsMTR4 also physically interact. Our data show that the NRDE-2/MTR-4 interactions are evolutionarily conserved, and that, in C. elegans, the NRDE-2/MTR-4 complex contributes to siRNA-directed cotranscriptional gene silencing.
